_`Welcome to informatics documentation!`
========================================

**informatics** is a fast construction utility for scientific computation pipeline in Python. With this project
we aim to establish:

* a generic and prototypical AI development-oriented tool-kit for scientific computation, analytics, and data
  visualization;

* an uniform protocol for packaging abstract data processing flow, in order to integrating workflows from varying
  code styles;

* the tutorial materials about numerical computation and mathematical modeling on essential principles, and
  programming practices.

The data to be supported mainly with this platform, targeted for but not limited to `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_
array.
