_`Adaptive AI with online learning`
===================================

The architectural analysis of edge intelligence systems across domains mentioned in
:ref:`previous tutorial <Streaming data, edge computing and online learning>`, from life-saving surgical
robotics to ambient-aware smart homes, reveals a fundamental truth: true device autonomy hinges on an
algorithm's capacity for perpetual contextual adaptation. As established in our prior examination of streaming
data ecosystems, edge devices operate in inherently nonstationary environments where sensor patterns, user
behaviors, and operational constraints evolve continuously. This dynamism renders conventional static models
obsolete, demanding instead AI systems that implement *sustained environmental symbiosis* through online
learning mechanisms.

The critical differentiator lies not in hardware specifications, but in a model's architectural capacity to
organically assimilate streaming data. Successful edge intelligence implementations share a common DNA: machine
learning architectures that treat data ingestion as a continuous calibration process rather than discrete
training episodes.

_`Redefining intelligence via adaptive models`
----------------------------------------------

_`Breaking the infinite modeling cycle`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the term *model* remains ubiquitous in AI practice, practitioners often find themselves trapped in an
infinite loop of model-design → deployment → concept drift → re-modeling. This Sisyphean cycle stems from
treating models as fixed-parameter predictors frozen in temporal specificity. In edge intelligence contexts,
successful implementations redefine models as *continuously evolving entities* - dynamic systems that
self-calibrate through perpetual interaction with their operational environments.

_`Mathematical metaphors for adaptive systems`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Effective edge AI mirrors how mathematicians distinguish between function families (e.g., quadratic functions)
and specific implementations (e.g., y=2x²+3). Consider economic policymaking: while applying Shanghai's
income benchmarks to rural Gansu would fail, the underlying methodology of per-capita analysis remains sound.
This reveals the core paradigm the edge AI implementations require:

- **Meta-architectures** providing methodological frameworks

- **Contextual instantiation** through localized data streams

- **Bayesian adaptability** enabling probabilistic adjustments

This approach transforms models from static equations into *smart containers* that maintain core analytical
principles, dynamically adjust parameters like regulatory policies adapting to regional economies, and preserve
computational efficiency through selective updates.

_`Self evolving meta models and demonstrations`
-----------------------------------------------

Here we contextualize the :numref:`generic latency-sensitive pipe` on an edged health metric tracking system.
The following implementation embodies the core principles of edge AI adaptability through a Bayesian meta-container
architecture designed for multi-parameter health monitoring. This self-evolving system demonstrates how medical
diagnostic devices can maintain operational relevance amidst gradual physiological shifts.

   from info.me import bayes as bys
   from scipy import stats as st
   from queue import Queue
   import numpy as np

   avg_height, avg_weight, avg_heart_rate = 170, 65, 85
   avg_mean = np.array([avg_height, avg_weight, avg_heart_rate])
   init_dis = st.multivariate_normal(avg_mean, np.eye(len(avg_mean)))
   meta, container = bys.gaussian(kernel=init_dis), Queue()
   shift_dis = st.multivariate_normal(avg_mean + np.array([-5, 4, 5]), np.eye(len(avg_mean)))  # data shift simulator
   _ = [container.put(shift_dis.rvs(30)) for _ in range(10)]

   while not container.empty():
       meta.update_posterior(posterior=container.get())

   print(meta.conjugate.mean)
   # [164.5150496   68.71274824  89.69390676], may vary

In the :numref:`dynamic bayesian health metric tracking system` we assumed the independence hypothesis among variable
:code:`avg_height`, :code:`avg_weight`, and :code:`avg_heart_rate` for simplification; If any canonical knowledge is
accessible (e.g., :ref:`WHO <WHO>` standards), their correlation, as prior knowledge, can also be embedded inside.
