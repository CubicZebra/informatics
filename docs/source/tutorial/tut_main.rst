_`Edge devices and self-adaption AI`
------------------------------------

This tutorial explores how intelligent edge systems unify streaming data, edge computing, and adaptive machine
learning to enable self-improving AI in resource-constrained environments. Learn to process raw data streams
locally into real-time insights—eliminating cloud dependency—while addressing hardware limits, dynamic data shifts,
and privacy risks.   Through real-world examples, explore systems where AI models improve themselves using live
data—without sacrificing speed, precision, or edge-device performance.
