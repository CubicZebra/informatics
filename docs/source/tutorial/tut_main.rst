   Scripting via function <tut_func>
   Pipelining data process <tut_pipe>
   :maxdepth: 2

_`Data access and processing`
-----------------------------

This collection of tutorials provides foundational guidance on managing, transforming, and preparing data for
biomedical and imaging workflows.  Topics include efficient data inflow strategies, format conversion techniques,
specialized handling of DICOM metadata, and practical methods for data augmentation to enhance dataset utility.
Explore these guides to streamline data workflows, ensure compatibility across tools, and optimize inputs for
downstream analysis or machine learning applications.

_`Edge devices and self-adaption AI`
------------------------------------

These tutorials explore how intelligent edge systems unify streaming data, edge computing, and adaptive machine
learning to enable self-improving AI in resource-constrained environments. Learn to process raw data streams
locally into real-time insights—eliminating cloud dependency—while addressing hardware limits, dynamic data shifts,
and privacy risks. Through real-world examples, explore systems where AI models improve themselves using live
data—without sacrificing speed, precision, or edge-device performance.
