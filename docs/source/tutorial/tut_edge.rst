_`Streaming data, edge computing and online learning`
=====================================================

.. main title, edge device and self-adaption artificial intelligence

Streaming data—generated continuously from sensors, :ref:`IoT <IoT>` devices, and real-time transactions—requires
low-latency processing due to its high velocity and unbounded nature. Edge computing addresses these demands by
decentralizing computation to devices near data sources, enabling faster response times, reduced cloud dependency,
and bandwidth optimization.

_`Edge computing on data stream`
--------------------------------

As a decentralized counterpart to centralized cloud computing, edge computing enhances data privacy and security by
processing information locally (:numref:`Figure %s <cloud and edge computing>`). This approach significantly reduces
network transmissions, minimizes attack surfaces, and strengthens defenses against cyber threats. However, despite
these advantages, edge computing's application in streaming data processing remains constrained by three key factors:
limited data throughput, heterogeneous computational capabilities, and diverse hardware architectures across edge
devices. Addressing these limitations would enable direct, real-time manipulation of device-generated data streams,
thereby unlocking the full potential of localized artificial intelligence (AI) for instant decision-making.

_`Incremental online learning and edge AI`
------------------------------------------

Incremental online learning (IOL) and edge artificial intelligence (Edge AI) represent a transformative paradigm for
deploying adaptive machine learning models in resource-constrained, latency-sensitive environments. Unlike
traditional cloud-centric approaches reliant on batch training with static datasets, IOL enables models to update
dynamically using streaming data, while edge AI embeds lightweight inference and training capabilities directly on
edge devices. This synergy addresses critical challenges in real-time data processing, such as latency reduction,
bandwidth optimization, and privacy preservation.

The interplay among streaming data, edge computing, and online learning is schematically depicted in 
:numref:`Figure %s <streaming data for edge computing>`. This framework highlights how edge-deployed AI models aim
to balance two critical objectives: (1) efficient utilization of constrained computational resources (e.g., limited
memory, energy budgets), and (2) real-time responsiveness with self-adaptation to concept drift (e.g., evolving sensor
patterns or environmental dynamics).

   streaming data, edge computing and AI

_`Edge intelligence implementation strategies`
----------------------------------------------

Real-world edge intelligence systems rarely rely on a single technique—they weave together streaming data, adaptive
learning, and hardware-aware optimizations to address domain-specific constraints. We now dissect three canonical
strategies that epitomize how these components interact, balancing latency, resource efficiency, and privacy.

_`Real-time priority system`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Latency-sensitive edge systems require:

- **hard deadlines**: predictable execution windows (20ms-1s)

- **guaranteed throughput**: processing rate ≥ peak data ingestion rate

- **decoupled architecture**: isolation between data ingestion/compute stages

The template in :numref:`generic latency-sensitive pipe` enforces these requirements through thread-safe queues and
modular processing:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: generic latency-sensitive pipe
   :name: generic latency-sensitive pipe

   from queue import Queue

   consumer, processing, model = Queue(), ..., ...
   ...
   while True:
       while not consumer.empty():
           _tmp = processing(consumer.get())
           model.train_or_predict(_tmp)

This pattern's value lies in its field-agnostic structure. The same queue-driven pipeline can power endoscopic video
analysis in surgical robots, defect detection on manufacturing lines, or obstacle avoidance in autonomous
vehicles—simply by substituting domain-specific :code:`processing` logic and :code:`model` implementations while
retaining the core deadline control mechanism.

_`Resource-aware hybrid pipelines`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. need deepseek generation like `Real-time priority system` here.

Balancing immediate inference needs with periodic model refinement requires hybrid architectures that dynamically
allocate resources based on operational context (e.g., power availability, CPU load). These pipelines prioritize
critical tasks while opportunistically utilizing idle resources for model improvement. Its technical mechanisms
are generally featured as:

- **queue prioritization**: split data streams into urgent/non-urgent queues

- **dynamic batching**: aggregate training data during low-activity periods

- **power-sensitive scheduling**: trigger model updates only when external power is available

The template in :numref:`dynamic priority scheduling` enforces these requirements through thread-safe queues and
modular processing:

The :numref:`dynamic priority scheduling` operationalizes this strategy through three key components:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: dynamic priority scheduling
   :name: dynamic priority scheduling

   from queue import Queue

   urgent, delay, device, model = Queue(maxsize=100), Queue(maxsize=1000), ..., ...
   ...
   while True:

       while not urgent.empty():
           _tmp = model.predict(urgent.get())
           ...

       if device.power_source == 'external' and device.is_in_idle():

           while not delay.empty():
               _tmp = dynamic_batch(delay)
               model.train(_tmp)

This pattern’s modular design allows seamless adaptation across domains. For instance, surgical robots may prioritize
real-time tissue segmentation (:code:`urgent` queue) while deferring post-operative model updates to charging intervals
(:code:`delay` queue). Similarly, smart home gateways could process security alerts immediately but delay learning
user behavior patterns until nighttime.

By retaining the core mechanisms—priority queues, dynamic batching, and power-aware triggers—developers need only
redefine domain-specific handlers for urgent tasks, delayed operations, and hardware interfaces, ensuring
adaptability without compromising deterministic execution guarantees.

_`Federated edge adaptation`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decentralized edge intelligence systems require:

- **data isolation**: no raw data leaves source devices

- **concept drift resilience**: local adaptation to device-specific data shifts

- **secure knowledge fusion**: cryptographic aggregation of localized updates

The template in :numref:`federated edge system` implements these requirements through encrypted parameter exchange
and localized learning:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: federated edge system
   :name: federated edge system

   class FederatedCoordinator:

       def __init__(self):
           self.nodes, self.global_state = [EdgeNode(), ...], None

       def aggregate(self):
           encrypted_updates = [n.get_encrypted() for n in self.nodes]
           self.global_state = secure_aggregate(encrypted_updates)

       def distribute(self):
           for n in self.nodes:
               n.receive(encrypt(self.global_state))

   class EdgeNode:

       def __init__(self):
           self.local_model, self.stream_queue, self.cache = ..., ..., ...

       def get_encrypted(self):
           update = self._compute_update()
           return encrypt(update)

       def receive(self, encrypted_state):
           global_update = decrypt(encrypted_state)
           self.local_model.merge(global_update)

       def _compute_update(self):
           while not self.stream_queue.empty():
               data = self.stream_queue.get()
               if self._detect_drift(data):
                   self._adapt_model()
               self.cache.store(self.local_model.learn(data))
           return self.cache.export()

       def _adapt_model(self):
           self.local_model = adjust_structure(
               self.local_model,
               context=self.stream_queue.stats()
           )

Federated edge adaptation establishes a privacy-preserving framework for decentralized intelligence systems, where
edge devices collaboratively evolve models without exposing raw data. By enforcing data isolation through encrypted
parameter exchange, enabling concept drift resilience via localized model adjustments, and ensuring secure knowledge
fusion via cryptographic aggregation, this architecture bridges the gap between distributed autonomy and collective
intelligence. The provided template supports diverse learning paradigms—from Bayesian updates to online rule
refinement—by decoupling domain-specific implementations (e.g., medical image analysis, industrial IoT monitoring)
from core mechanisms like drift detection and secure synchronization. This balance of adaptability and security
positions federated edge adaptation as a foundational pillar for next-generation applications demanding both privacy
and real-time responsiveness.
