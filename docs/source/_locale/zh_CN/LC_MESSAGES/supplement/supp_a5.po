"Monte Carlo is a powerful technique used to understand and analyze "
"complex systems by generating synthetic data that mimic real-world "
"processes. It can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic "
"interpretation. By creating virtual experiments that are difficult or "
"even impossible to study through traditional methods on computer, it "
"provides approximate solutions to problems that are too intractable to be"
" analyzed mathematically, enables many scientific and technological "
"breakthroughs in fields such like physics, engineering, finance."

"The Monte Carlo is often associated with Markov Chain due to its inherent"
" stochastic nature, which typically manifests as a stochastic process.  "
"Contrary to simultaneous generation, the pseudo data points are "
"determined individually in a sequential manner.  Beginning with an "
"initial point, subsequent cases are sampled from the conditional "
"probability. This process is iteratively repeated, thereby establishing a"
" connection with the concept of random walk."

"A Monte Carlo Markov Chain can be recognized with the property that from "
"any initial start point, it will converge towards an identical stationary"
" distribution if the period for generation is long enough "
