"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the abstraction for things that have"
" *noun* attribute. Just like biological classification, scientists use "
"the context *Domain*, *Kingdom*, *Phylum*, *Class*, *Order*, *Family*, "
"and *Genus* to describe creatures. It is scientifically rigorous, "
"comprehensive, but not such flexible to deal with open set. (for example "
"to describe a totally new specie which can not been interpreted in this "
"system indeed)."

"Functional programming (FP) is the abstraction for things that have "
"*verb* attribute. We describe the data without modification *raw*; we "
"define the process steps for data as *preprocessing*; we called the "
"behaviors of extracting informative things from data *feature "
"engineering*; we *train* to find the pattern possibly underlying the "
"data. No matter what investigation in what field we are struggling, we "
"repeat those behaviors step by step, always."

"Like many other programming languages, python is also supports multi-"
"paradigm well. The function can be used as value to pass in, the modified"
" function can be return as a value as well, after which the "
":ref:`currying <function currying>` occurs."

"The term _`function currying` refers the changes of calling for function "
"with form of :code:`f1(a, b, c)`, into the form as :code:`f2(a)(b)(c)`. "
"In modern programming, this architecture is helpful to decoupling our "
"operation logic on data. In the last form, :code:`f2(a)` return a "
"function that the behavior :code:`a` is determined; then :code:`f2(a)(b)`"
" return the behavior :code:`b` is determined as well; assume the "
":code:`c` is the data, it is clear that data :code:`c` can be processed, "
"if and only if the pre-processes :code:`a` and :code:`b` are pre defined."
