"In :ref:`previous section <High dimensional data>` we discuss about how "
"dataset organized in form of matrix. Thus, knowledge about matrix, will "
"contribute for correctly building downstream analysis flow."

"For a design matrix :math:`\\boldsymbol{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times "
"m}` where :math:`n` and :math:`m` refer the numbers of observations "
"(samples) and data dimensions, respectively, most statistical methods are"
" of basis on certain hypothesis, in which condition that requires the "
"design matrix to satisfy certain properties (usually related to :math:`n`"
" and :math:`m`). Therefore, the estimation for some problems such like "
"how large of the data scale should be prepared for an experiment, or the "
"rational number of dimension for modeling the data, can be deducted "
"through matrix properties, on the basis of scientific rigor, instead of "
"empiricism."

"Rank of matrix corresponds to the maximal dimension of a *no-"
"degeneration* (see :ref:`degeneration <degeneracy>`) linear system. In "
"most cases, :math:`m \\neq n`, therefore the rank of "
":math:`\\boldsymbol{M}` will be like :math:`\\mathrm{r}(\\boldsymbol{M}) "
"= \\min{(m, n)}`. Using linear model as example, when :math:`m` is much "
"greater than :math:`n`, the upper bound of matrix rank, that means most "
"dimensions in that design matrix are redundant to be removed through "
"dimension reduction component. In reverse, in case of :math:`m \\lt n`, "
"the number of observations is sufficient for building linear (or "
"generalized linear) model."

"linear model here can be conventional linear function like square error "
":math:`f(\\boldsymbol{M}) = (\\boldsymbol{M} - "
"\\overline{\\boldsymbol{M}})(\\boldsymbol{M} - "
"\\overline{\\boldsymbol{M}})^T`, or other derived methods "
":math:`f(\\boldsymbol{M}, \\dots)` such like Pearson correlation "
"coefficient (PCC), Pearson product moment correlation coefficient "
"(PPMCC), or other formats with different location and rescale items "
"(detailed definition see :ref:`SPSS tutorial <[SPSS2014]>`)."
