   informatics

Informatics, sourced from its original meaning: the sciences concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing,
retrieving, and classifying recorded information.

It is designed to enable users solve complex problems in science, engineering, and other domains efficiently and
accurately. Its powerful capabilities are achieved through a combination of cutting-edge software engineering
techniques and the elegance of Python's functional programming paradigm. The strength of highly modular and extensible
architecture allows users to quickly assemble and customize data processing pipelines to satisfy their specific needs.
Whether it's data cleaning, transformation, analysis, or visualization, informatics provides a rich set of tools and
functions to facilitate these tasks.

Informatics is built to serve for science as well as engineer domains. It provides ready-made solutions for common
tasks like feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and more. Refer the
`documentation <https://informatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for a detailed information about its
essential designs, functions, as well as applied scopes.

Main Features
=============

Here list a few of things that informatics featured:

* Powerful integration capability for various utilities (e.g. functions, frames, packages, and etc.) in Python
  ecosystem.

* Universal processing interface designed in high dimensionality to guarantee consistency of calling for different
  types of data.

* Scripting on basis of functional programming paradigm, with properties of robust performance, and easy decoupling
  for extension.

* Intuitive combination of data processing units, for fast experiments, validation, or building for upper
  applications.

* Documentation in details for not only basic functions, but the tutorials, interpretation for essential concepts,
  examples of applications, and such like.
